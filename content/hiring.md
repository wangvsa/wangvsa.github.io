## Hiring

<!-- I have multiple fully funded Ph.D. scholarships available for the January and August 2026 intakes. -->
I am always eager to work with self-motivated students who are passionate about pursuing cutting-edge research. My research areas include, but are not limited to:

- High-Performance Computing (HPC)
- Distributed Storage Systems & Parallel File Systems
- Systems for AI/LLMs
- Performance Modeling & Analysis
- Parallel I/O

For Ph.D. applicants, candidates must at minimum meet NTU’s admission requirements. Please refer to the official NTU [admission guide](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/graduate/radmissionguide) for details.
<!--I review every CV I receive; however, *only* shortlisted candidates will be contacted for further discussion.-->

**Opportunities for NTU Undergraduates**

I am co-advising NTU’s [Student Cluster Competition team](https://ntuhpc.org). NTU undergraduates interested in supercomputing can join the team to gain hands-on experience with HPC systems and potentially travel to competitions in the U.S. and Germany. 

If you're interested in working with me, please contact me at <ins>*chen.wang AT ntu.edu.sg*</ins>.
