## Hiring

I will be joining Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)) in Fall 2025 as an Assistant Professor in the College of Computing and Data Science ([CCDS](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing)).
I currently have two fully funded Ph.D. scholarships available for the January and August 2026 intakes.
I am looking for self-motivated students with a strong background in Computer Science or related fields, who are passionate about conducting cutting-edge research. My research areas include, but are not limited to:

- High-Performance Computing (HPC)
- High-Performance Storage Systems & Parallel File Systems
- Systems for AI/LLMs
- Performance Modeling & Analysis
- Parallel I/O

At a minimum, candidates must meet NTU’s Ph.D. admission criteria. Please refer to the official NTU [admission guide](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/graduate/radmissionguide) for details.
I review every CV I receive; however, *only* shortlisted candidates will be contacted for further discussion.

**Opportunities for NTU Undergraduates**

I will also be co-advising NTU’s Student [Cluster Competition team](https://ntuhpc.org). NTU undergraduates interested in supercomputing can join the team to gain hands-on experience with HPC systems and potentially travel to competitions in the U.S. and Germany.

If you're interested in working with me, please contact me at <ins>*wangvsa AT gmail DOT com*</ins>.
