## Chen Wang

I am an Assistant Professor in the College of Computing and Data Science ([CCDS](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing)) at Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)).
Before joining NTU, I was the [Fernbach Postdoctoral Fellow](https://computing.llnl.gov/about/people-highlights/chen-wang) at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing ([CASC](https://computing.llnl.gov/casc)) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I worked with [Dr. Kathryn Mohror](https://people.llnl.gov/mohror1).
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, under the guidance of [Prof. Marc Snir](https://snir.cs.illinois.edu). Fun fact: I have an [Erdős number](http://wwwp.oakland.edu/enp/) of 3 through Marc :).

My research interests include high-performance computing, storage system, system for AI/LLM, parallel file system, performance analysis, etc. During my Ph.D. and postdoctoral research, I have extensively studied performance issues related to POSIX consistency and explored the design of next-generation high-performance storage systems. Many of the [projects](/projects) I have been involved in are centered around these areas.

### Teaching

NTU Undergrads: We’ve just restarted the Parallel Computing course (SC4050). Consider taking it if you’re interested in high-performance computing, supercomputers, or large-scale GPU programming.
In addition, I am developing a dedicated GPU-oriented course (4000-level MPE), which I hope to offer starting in 2026.

### Hiring

I am actively looking for self-motivated students. If you're interested in working with me, please check out this [page](/hiring) for more details.
